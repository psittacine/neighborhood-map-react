## Project for Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

#### Project Overview

You will develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

You will learn how design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

### Instructions:

* Go to the project directory in the terminal.
* Run the command `yarn install` to install all project dependencies.
* Run the command `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
* Run the command `yarn build` to create a production build.

#### Notes
